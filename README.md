## Overview

Book Library is a web application that allows users to browse and search for books using an API. The application provides features like search, sorting, list/grid view, and pagination.

## Features

- **Fetch books from API** dynamically.
- **Search functionality** to filter books by title.
- **Sorting options** to arrange books alphabetically and by date.
- **List/Grid view toggle** for different layout preferences.
- **Pagination support** to navigate between different pages of books.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Free API](https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/public/books) for fetching book data.

## API Endpoint

Books are fetched from the following API:

```
https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/public/books
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandanprogrammer/book-library.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd book-library
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, book data is fetched from the API and displayed.
2. Users can **search** for books by title.
3. Users can **sort** books by name (A-Z, Z-A) or by date (newest to oldest, oldest to newest).
4. The **view mode** can be switched between grid and list.
5. Users can **navigate** through the book collection using pagination.
